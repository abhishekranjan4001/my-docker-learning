# Introduction to Docker  

Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. It helps developers build lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Use Docker?
- **Portability**: Run anywhere (local machine, cloud, server).
- **Efficiency**: Uses fewer resources than virtual machines.
- **Isolation**: Applications run independently without conflicts.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

## ðŸš€ How Docker Works?
1. **Dockerfile** - Defines how to build an image.
2. **Image** - A lightweight, standalone package of an application.
3. **Container** - A running instance of an image.
4. **Docker Hub** - A repository for storing and sharing Docker images.
